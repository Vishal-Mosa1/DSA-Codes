# 📌 DSA PATTERNS — HOW & WHEN TO USE

---

## 1️⃣ Sliding Window 🪟

### **When to use**

* Problems with **subarrays / substrings**
* “Maximum / Minimum / Longest / Shortest”
* **Continuous** elements
* Keywords: *subarray, substring, consecutive*

### **How it works**

* Use two pointers: `left` and `right`
* Expand window by moving `right`
* Shrink window by moving `left` when condition breaks

### **Common problems**

* Maximum sum subarray of size K
* Longest substring without repeating characters
* Minimum window substring
* Maximum consecutive ones

---

## 2️⃣ Two Pointers 👉👈

### **When to use**

* Sorted arrays / strings
* Pair problems
* Reverse / Palindrome checks
* Comparing from both ends

### **How it works**

* Start with two pointers (`left`, `right`)
* Move based on condition (sum too big → move right, etc.)

### **Common problems**

* Two Sum (sorted array)
* Palindrome check
* Container with most water

---

## 3️⃣ Prefix Sum ➕

### **When to use**

* Multiple **range sum queries**
* Subarray sum problems
* Need fast sum calculation

### **How it works**

* Precompute cumulative sum array
* Subarray sum = `prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]`

### **Common problems**

* Subarray sum equals K
* Range sum queries
* Equilibrium index

---

## 4️⃣ Binary Search 🔍

### **When to use**

* Sorted data
* “Find minimum / maximum possible value”
* Problems where answer space is sorted

### **How it works**

* Divide search space into half
* Check mid → move left or right

### **Common problems**

* Search in sorted array
* Minimum capacity / speed problems
* First & last occurrence

---

## 5️⃣ Hashing / HashMap #️⃣

### **When to use**

* Frequency counting
* Fast lookup
* Remove nested loops

### **How it works**

* Store counts / indices in HashMap or array
* Lookup in O(1)

### **Common problems**

* Two Sum
* Anagrams
* Longest consecutive sequence

---

## 6️⃣ Backtracking 🔄

### **When to use**

* All possible combinations / permutations
* Decision tree problems
* “Try all paths” with constraints

### **How it works**

* Choose → Explore → Unchoose
* Recursion with undoing step

### **Common problems**

* Subsets
* Permutations
* N-Queens

---

## 7️⃣ Dynamic Programming (DP) 🧠

### **When to use**

* Overlapping subproblems
* Optimal / maximum / minimum answers
* Recursion + memoization pattern

### **How it works**

* Break problem into smaller subproblems
* Store results to avoid recomputation

### **Common problems**

* Fibonacci
* Coin change
* Longest common subsequence

---

## 8️⃣ Greedy 💰

### **When to use**

* Locally optimal choice leads to global optimal
* Scheduling, intervals, selection problems

### **How it works**

* Make the best choice at each step
* No backtracking

### **Common problems**

* Activity selection
* Minimum coins
* Jump game

---

## 9️⃣ Graph Algorithms 🌐

### **When to use**

* Nodes & edges
* Relationships / connections
* Paths, cycles, connectivity

### **How it works**

* Use BFS / DFS / Dijkstra
* Traverse graph efficiently

### **Common problems**

* Number of islands
* Shortest path
* Cycle detection

DSA problems are not random.
Every problem belongs to a PATTERN.
Identify the pattern → solution becomes obvious
