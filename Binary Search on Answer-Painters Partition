PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer k representing the number of painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.
Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).

CODE:

public class PaintersPartition {

    public static int minTime(int[] boards, int painters) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;

        for (int b : boards) {
            left = Math.max(left, b); 
            right += b;             
        }

        int answer = right;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (canPaint(boards, painters, mid)) {
                answer = mid;        // valid
                right = mid - 1;     // try smaller time
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;      // need more time
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }

    private static boolean canPaint(int[] boards, int painters, int maxTime) {
        int paintersUsed = 1;
        int time = 0;

        for (int b : boards) {
            if (time + b <= maxTime) {
                time += b;
            } else {
                paintersUsed++;
                time = b;

                if (paintersUsed > painters) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] boards = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        int painters = 2;

        System.out.println(minTime(boards, painters));
    }
}


DRY RUN:

Input
Boards = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Painters = 2

Step 1: Answer Range
left  = max board = 40
right = sum = 100

🔹 Iteration 1
mid = (40 + 100) / 2 = 70


Check if painters can paint within 70:

Painter 1 → 10 + 20 + 30 = 60

Painter 2 → 40

Painters used = 2 ✅
👉 VALID

answer = 70
right = 69

🔹 Iteration 2
mid = (40 + 69) / 2 = 54


Painter 1 → 10 + 20 = 30

Painter 2 → 30

Painter 3 → 40 ❌

Painters used = 3 > 2
👉 INVALID

left = 55

🔹 Iteration 3
mid = (55 + 69) / 2 = 62


Painter 1 → 10 + 20 + 30 = 60

Painter 2 → 40

✅ VALID

answer = 62
right = 61

🔹 Iteration 4
mid = (55 + 61) / 2 = 58


Painters exceed ❌ → INVALID

left = 59

🔹 Iteration 5
mid = (59 + 61) / 2 = 60


Painter 1 → 10 + 20 + 30 = 60

Painter 2 → 40

✅ VALID

answer = 60


Loop ends.

✅ FINAL ANSWER
Minimum time = 60
