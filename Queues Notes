# 📌 QUEUE – COMPLETE NOTES (WITH EXAMPLES)

---> What is a Queue?
A **Queue** is a **linear data structure** that follows the rule:
### 👉 **FIFO – First In, First Out**
➡️ The element that enters **first** will leave **first**.

---> Real-Life Examples
* 🎬 Movie theater line
* 🖨️ Printer jobs
* 🌐 Web server requests
* 🚦 Traffic signal waiting line
* 📞 Call center waiting calls

---> Basic Queue Terminology
| Term          | Meaning                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Enqueue**   | Insert an element into the queue |
| **Dequeue**   | Remove an element from the queue |
| **Front**     | Position where deletion happens  |
| **Rear**      | Position where insertion happens |
| **Overflow**  | Queue is full                    |
| **Underflow** | Queue is empty                   |

---> How Queue Works (Concept)

FRONT → [ A ][ B ][ C ] ← REAR

* **Enqueue** → Insert at **REAR**
* **Dequeue** → Remove from **FRONT**

---> FIFO Explained (Very Important for Interviews)
If elements are added in this order:

Enqueue: 10 → 20 → 30

They will be removed like:

Dequeue: 10 → 20 → 30

➡️ **Same order in, same order out**

---> Queue Operations (With Examples)
### 1️⃣ Enqueue (Insertion)
**Definition:**
Adding a new element at the **rear end** of the queue.
**Example:**

Queue: [10, 20]
Enqueue(30)
Queue becomes: [10, 20, 30]


### 2️⃣ Dequeue (Deletion)
**Definition:**
Removing an element from the **front end** of the queue.
**Example:**

Queue: [10, 20, 30]
Dequeue()
Removed element: 10
Queue becomes: [20, 30]


### 3️⃣ Peek / Front
**Definition:**
Returns the element at the **front** without removing it.
**Example:**

Queue: [20, 30]
Peek → 20


### 4️⃣ isEmpty()
Checks if the queue is empty.

Queue: [ ]
Result → TRUE


### 5️⃣ isFull()
Checks if the queue is full (mainly in array implementation).

---> Types of Queues
### 1️⃣ Simple Queue (Linear Queue)
* Insertion at rear
* Deletion at front
* Problem: **wasted space** after deletions

### 2️⃣ Circular Queue ⭐ (Very Important)
* Last position connects back to first
* Solves space wastage problem

[ ][ ][ ][ ]
 ↑        ↓
 └────────┘


### 3️⃣ Priority Queue
* Each element has a **priority**
* Higher priority element is served first
**Example:**
* Hospital emergency patients
* CPU task scheduling

### 4️⃣ Deque (Double Ended Queue)
* Insertion & deletion allowed at **both ends**
Types:
* Input Restricted Deque
* Output Restricted Deque

---> Queue Implementation Methods
### 1️⃣ Array Implementation
* Uses fixed size array
* Faster access
* Can cause overflow

### 2️⃣ Linked List Implementation ⭐
* Dynamic size
* No overflow until memory full
* Extra memory for pointers

---> Time Complexity of Queue Operations
| Operation | Time |
|  | - |
| Enqueue   | O(1) |
| Dequeue   | O(1) |
| Peek      | O(1) |
| Search    | O(n) |

---> Common Interview Questions
1. Why Queue uses FIFO?
2. Difference between Stack and Queue
3. What is Circular Queue?
4. How to detect overflow and underflow?
5. Real-life applications of Queue
6. Queue using Stack
7. Stack using Queue

---> Queue vs Stack (Quick Comparison)
| Stack           | Queue                       |
|  |  |
| LIFO            | FIFO                        |
| Push / Pop      | Enqueue / Dequeue           |
| One end         | Two ends                    |
| Undo, Recursion | Scheduling, Waiting systems |

---> Where Queue is Used (Very Important)
* 🖨️ Printer job scheduling
* 🌐 Web servers
* 💻 CPU scheduling
* 📶 Network packet handling
* 🎮 Game turn systems
* 🚦 Traffic systems

---> Key Points to Remember
* Queue follows **FIFO**
* Enqueue → Rear
* Dequeue → Front
* Circular Queue solves space issue
* Queue is used when **order matters**

---> One-Line Definition (Perfect for Exams)
> **Queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO principle where insertion happens at rear and deletion happens at front.**
