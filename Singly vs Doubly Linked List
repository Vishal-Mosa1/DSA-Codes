Singly Linked List vs Doubly Linked List

## What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a **linear data structure** where elements (called **nodes**) are stored in **non-contiguous memory locations**.
Each node contains:

* **Data**
* **Reference (pointer)** to another node

## Singly Linked List (SLL)

### Definition

A **Singly Linked List** is a linked list in which **each node points only to the next node** in the sequence.

### Structure

[ Data | Next ] → [ Data | Next ] → [ Data | Next ] → NULL

### Node Representation

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

### Characteristics

* Each node has **one pointer (next)**
* Traversal is **one-directional (forward only)**
* Last node points to **NULL**

### Advantages

* Uses **less memory** (only one pointer)
* Simple to implement
* Faster insertion/deletion compared to arrays

### Disadvantages

* Cannot traverse backward
* Deleting a node requires access to the **previous node**
* Reverse traversal is not possible directly

### Example

Linked list values: `10 → 20 → 30`

Head → [10|•] → [20|•] → [30|NULL]

## Doubly Linked List (DLL)

### Definition

A **Doubly Linked List** is a linked list in which **each node contains two pointers**:

* One to the **previous node**
* One to the **next node**

### Structure


NULL ← [ Prev | Data | Next ] ⇄ [ Prev | Data | Next ] ⇄ [ Prev | Data | Next ] → NULL


### Node Representation

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* prev;
    struct Node* next;
};


### Characteristics

* Each node has **two pointers**
* Traversal is **bi-directional**
* First node’s `prev` is **NULL**
* Last node’s `next` is **NULL**

### Advantages

* Traversal in **both directions**
* Easy deletion (no need to track previous node)
* Useful for complex navigation

### Disadvantages

* Uses **extra memory**
* Slightly complex implementation
* Insertion/deletion takes more pointer updates

### Example

Linked list values: `10 ⇄ 20 ⇄ 30`

NULL ← [•|10|•] ⇄ [•|20|•] ⇄ [•|30|NULL]

->Singly vs Doubly Linked List – Comparison Table

| Feature            | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Pointers per node  | 1 (next)           | 2 (prev + next)    |
| Traversal          | One direction      | Both directions    |
| Memory usage       | Less               | More               |
| Backward traversal | ❌ Not possible     | ✅ Possible         |
| Deletion operation | Harder             | Easier             |
| Implementation     | Simple             | Complex            |
| Performance        | Slightly faster    | Slightly slower    |


## Real-World Use Cases

### Singly Linked List

* Stack implementation
* Queue implementation
* Simple memory-efficient lists
* Adjacency list in graphs

### Doubly Linked List

* Browser **back & forward navigation**
* Music player **previous/next song**
* Undo/Redo operations
* LRU Cache implementation

## Interview Tip

📌 **If memory is a concern → use Singly Linked List**
📌 **If backward traversal or frequent deletion is needed → use Doubly Linked List**

## Simple Example (Insertion at Beginning)

### Singly Linked List

newNode->next = head;
head = newNode;

### Doubly Linked List

newNode->next = head;
newNode->prev = NULL;
head->prev = newNode;
head = newNode;

##Summary (One-Line) : 
**Singly Linked List** is memory-efficient but one-directional, while **Doubly Linked List** allows two-way traversal at the cost of extra memory.
