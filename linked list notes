Linked List – Complete Notes

What is a Linked List?
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes.
Each node contains:
	•	Data → actual value
	•	Next → reference (pointer) to the next node

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory.

Structure of a Node
| Data | Next |

Example:
10 → 20 → 30 → NULL

->Types of Linked List

1. Singly Linked List
	•	Each node points to the next node
	•	Traversal is one-directional

10 → 20 → 30 → NULL

2. Doubly Linked List
	•	Each node has prev and next
	•	Traversal is two-directional

NULL ← 10 ⇄ 20 ⇄ 30 → NULL

3. Circular Linked List
	•	Last node points back to the first node
	•	No NULL at the end

10 → 20 → 30
↑           ↓
└───────────┘


Why Linked List?

✅ Dynamic size
✅ Easy insertion & deletion
❌ No direct indexing
❌ Extra memory for pointers

Basic Operations

-> Traversal

Visit each node from head to tail.

Head → 10 → 20 → 30 → NULL

-> Insertion

1. Insert at Beginning

Before: 10 → 20 → NULL
After : 5 → 10 → 20 → NULL

2. Insert at End

Before: 10 → 20 → NULL
After : 10 → 20 → 30 → NULL

3. Insert at Position

Insert 15 at position 2
10 → 15 → 20 → NULL

-> Deletion

1. Delete from Beginning

10 → 20 → 30 → NULL
→ 20 → 30 → NULL

2. Delete from End

10 → 20 → 30 → NULL
→ 10 → 20 → NULL

-> Time Complexity

Operation	Time
Access	O(n)
Insert at Head	O(1)
Insert at Tail	O(n)
Delete	O(n)
Search	O(n)


Real-Life Examples

📌 Music playlist (next song)
📌 Browser history
📌 Undo / Redo operations
📌 Image viewer (next / previous image)

-> Interview Tip ⭐

Use Linked List when frequent insertions/deletions are needed and Array when fast access is required.
