# 🍌 Problem statement

**Input**

```
piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]
H = 8 hours
```

**Goal**
👉 Find the **minimum eating speed (bananas/hour)** such that Koko can finish all bananas within **8 hours**.

---

# 🧠 Key Idea (Very Important)

* We are **NOT searching the array**
* We are searching the **ANSWER (speed)**

Possible speed range:

```
Minimum speed = 1
Maximum speed = max(piles) = 11
```

This range is **sorted** → Binary Search applicable ✅

```java
public class KokoEatingBananas {

    public static int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = 0;

        // Find maximum pile (right boundary)
        for (int pile : piles) {
            right = Math.max(right, pile);
        }

        int answer = right;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (canEatAll(piles, mid, h)) {
                // mid is valid, try smaller speed
                answer = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                // mid is invalid, need bigger speed
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }

    private static boolean canEatAll(int[] piles, int speed, int h) {
        int hoursNeeded = 0;

        for (int pile : piles) {
            // ceil(pile / speed)
            hoursNeeded += (pile + speed - 1) / speed;
        }

        return hoursNeeded <= h;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] piles = {3, 6, 7, 11};
        int h = 8;

        System.out.println(minEatingSpeed(piles, h)); // Output: 4
    }
}

# 🔍 Dry Run (STEP-BY-STEP, VERY CLEAR)

### Initial Setup

```
piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]
H = 8

left = 1
right = 11
answer = 11
```

---

## 🔹 Iteration 1

```
mid = (1 + 11) / 2 = 6
```

Check if speed = **6** is valid:

| Pile      | Hours needed |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 3         | 1            |
| 6         | 1            |
| 7         | 2            |
| 11        | 2            |
| **Total** | **6 hours**  |

```
6 ≤ 8 → VALID ✅
```

👉 Since valid, try **smaller speed**

```
answer = 6
right = 5
```

---

## 🔹 Iteration 2

```
left = 1, right = 5
mid = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3
```

Check speed = **3**:

| Pile      | Hours needed |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 3         | 1            |
| 6         | 2            |
| 7         | 3            |
| 11        | 4            |
| **Total** | **10 hours** |

```
10 > 8 → INVALID ❌
```

👉 Speed too slow → increase speed

```
left = 4
```

---

## 🔹 Iteration 3

```
left = 4, right = 5
mid = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4
```

Check speed = **4**:

| Pile      | Hours needed |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 3         | 1            |
| 6         | 2            |
| 7         | 2            |
| 11        | 3            |
| **Total** | **8 hours**  |

```
8 ≤ 8 → VALID ✅
```

👉 Try smaller speed again

```
answer = 4
right = 3
```

---

## 🔚 Loop Ends

```
left = 4, right = 3 → stop
```

---

# 🎯 Final Answer

```
Minimum eating speed = 4 bananas/hour
```

# 🧠 ONE-LINE INTERVIEW SUMMARY (VERY IMPORTANT)

> **Binary Search on Answers works because once a speed is valid, all higher speeds are also valid (monotonic).**
