SLIDING WINDOW RULE SHEET

Golden Rule:
Condition NOT satisfied ® EXPAND window
Condition satisfied ® SHRINK window to OPTIMIZE

When to Use Sliding Window:
• Subarray / Substring problems
• Continuous elements
• Max / Min / Longest / Shortest keywords

Types of Sliding Window:
Fixed Window: Size K is constant (Ex: Max sum subarray of size K)
Variable Window: Size changes (Ex: Longest substring, Min window substring)

Expand Logic:
• Move right pointer
• Add element to window
• Use when condition is NOT satisfied

Shrink Logic:
• Move left pointer
• Remove element from window
• Use when condition IS satisfied

Common Mistake:
• Expanding even after condition is satisfied

Key Reminder:
Right pointer builds the window
Left pointer optimizes the window

Examples:
• Min Window Substring ® Expand to match, shrink to minimize
• Max Consecutive Ones ® Expand, shrink when zeros > K
• Longest Substring ® Expand, shrink on duplicate

One Line Summary:
Sliding Window is about knowing WHEN to expand and WHEN to shrink.
